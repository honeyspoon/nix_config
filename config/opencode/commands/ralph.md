# Ralph Wiggum Loop Mode

You are now in Ralph Wiggum mode - an autonomous self-correcting loop.

## Instructions

Work on the following task iteratively until complete:

$ARGUMENTS

## How to work

1. Analyze the current state of the codebase
2. Make incremental progress on the task
3. Run tests/builds to verify your changes work
4. If something fails, fix it before continuing
5. Keep working until the task is fully complete

## Completion Signal

When the task is **completely done** and verified working, output exactly:

```
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>
```

Do NOT output this signal until:
- All code changes are made
- Tests pass (if applicable)
- Build succeeds (if applicable)
- The feature/fix is fully functional

## Important

- Be thorough - don't declare complete prematurely
- Fix any errors you encounter along the way
- Commit your changes as you go
- If stuck, explain what's blocking you
